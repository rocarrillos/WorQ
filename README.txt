# WorQ
Standalone Windows32 app for easier workstation sharing

I was inspired to create this after dealing with a situation at work where a 
prototype device was controlled by a single workstation, so people (me included)
would constantly be popping in and out of the lab to see if it was free.

For starters, I want the app to be a simple window where you can see who is 
currently using the computer and the queue of people that are lined up to use it
afterwards (hence the work queue--WorQ). There will of course be a way to sign 
yourself up with a name and a PIN to prevent someone from signing you off without 
you knowing.

Eventually, I'd like to add a type of WorQ Client where you can query the status 
of a work queue from another computer that is on the same network so you don't 
have to leave your desk to find out if you can use the machine.
